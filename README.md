# Patent Search & Analysis Web-Application
Patent Search & Analysis Web-Application aims to provide services to innovators regarding their ideas and innovations. Transforming ideas and its implementation is a source for increased standards in the society. The world at large has been witnessing a lot of changes since it’s existence. Each civilization which has come into being has been technologically advanced from the previous ones. Each device has its importance and also it has a scope for betterment in order which the currently available mechanizations. These unique schemes are very much possible because of their creators and they ought to get the deserved recognition for the same. Patent Search & Analysis Web-Application will result as a single place where people can search if their idea is idiosyncratic enough, if something like it is already existing in the market or not. If one’s search reveals a nearly identical invention has already been patented, the invention will not satisfy the novelty requirement for patentability. For collecting such huge amount of data, we would require a good knowledge of database management system (DBMS), data handling and analysis, searching and sorting algorithms along with basic implementations of website building and maintenance. User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX) is another essentially required field of expertise for best application of the plan. Overall Patent Search & Analysis Web-Application shall provide a platform to innovators to check if their ideas are already register or not, as patent search is critically important so that their time and money does not go in vein. With this tool, we aim to provide one click solution to several intellectual property (IP) related queries including prior art.
